# libkzg

This is a Typescript library which implements the [KZG10 polynominal
commitment](https://www.iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2010/6477178/6477178.pdf)
scheme.

It can produce and verify proofs of one point per proof, or multiple points per
proof.

## Functions

### `genCoefficients`: generate a polynominal from arbitrary values
**`genCoefficients = (values: bigint[]): Coefficient[]`**

Given a list of arbitrary values, use polynominal interpolation to generate the
coefficients of a polynominal to commit. Each value must be lower than the
BN254 scalar field order:

`21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495617`

### `commit`: generate a polynominal commitment

**`commit = (coefficients: bigint[]): Commitment`**

Generate a commitment to the polynominal with the specified coefficients.

### `genProof`: generate a proof of evaluation at one point

**`genProof = (coefficients: Coefficient[], index: number | bigint): Proof`**

Generate a proof (also known as a witness) that the polynominal will evaluate
to `p(index)` given `index` as the x-value.

### `verify`: verify a proof of evaluation at one point

**`verify = (commitment: Commitment, proof: Proof, index: number | bigint, value: bigint): boolean`**

Given a proof, verify that the polynominal with the specified commitment
evaluates to the y-value `value` at the x-value `index`.

### `genMultiProof`: generate a proof of evaluation at multiple points

**`genMultiProof = (coefficients: Coefficient[], indices: number[] | bigint[]): MultiProof`**

Generate a proof (also known as a witness) that the polynominal will evaluate
to `p(indices[i])` per `i`.

### `verifyMulti`: verify a proof of evaulation at multiple points

**`verifyMulti = (commitment: Commitment, proof: MultiProof, indices: number[] | bigint[], values: bigint[])`**

Given a proof, verify that the polynominal with the specified commitment
evaluates to the each y-value in `values` at the corresponding x-value in
`indices`.

### `genVerifierContractParams`: generate parameters to the verifier contract's `verify()` function

**`genVerifierContractParams = (commitment: Commitment, proof: Proof, index: number | bigint, value: bigint)`**

A helper function which generates parameters to the `KZGVerifier.verify()`.

Example usage: 

```ts
const params = genVerifierContractParams(commitment, proof, i, yVal)
const result = await verifierContract.verify(
    params.commitment,
    params.proof,
    params.index,
    params.value,
)
```

## Solidity contract

The repository contains a Solidity contract with a `verify()` function which
performs on-chain proof verification for single-point proofs:

```sol
function verify(
    Pairing.G1Point memory _commitment,
    Pairing.G1Point memory _proof,
    uint256 _index,
    uint256 _value
) public view returns (bool)
```

It consumes about 178078 gas when called by a contract.

It also provides a `commit()` function which can generate KZG commitments for
up to 128 coefficients. This function is intended for multi-point proof
verification.

| Coefficients | Execution cost |
|-|-|
| 1 | 34929 |
| 2 | 47496 |
| 4 | 72608 |
| 5 | 85177 |
| 8 | 122889 |
| 16 | 223476 |
| 32 | 424786 |
| 64 | 827980 |
| 128 | 1649494 |

By comparison, the Poseidon T=3 function which hashes 2 elements per call
consumes 49858 gas. Additionally, the Poseidon T=6 function which hashes 5
elements per call consumes 112055 gas.

This means that KZG commitments may be competitive as the accumulator for a
Verkle tree. The downside is that it is much more difficult to verify KZG
proofs in zero-knowledge, while the Poseidon hash function is built for
efficiency in zk-SNARK circuits.

The `verifyMulti()` function provides multi-point proof verification.

```
function verifyMulti(
    Pairing.G1Point memory _commitment,
    Pairing.G2Point memory _proof,
    uint256[] memory _indices,
    uint256[] memory _values,
    uint256[] memory _iCoeffs,
    uint256[] memory _zCoeffs
) public view returns (bool)
```

It consumes the following gas per point:

| Points | Cost | % Savings |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | 193084 | -8 |
| 2 | 221505 | 38 |
| 3 | 250283 | 53 |
| 4 | 280075 | 61 |
| 5 | 310152 | 65 |
| 6 | 341279 | 68 |
| 7 | 372763 | 70 |
| 8 | 405237 | 72 |
| 9 | 438008 | 73 |
| 50 | 2368081 | 73 |
| 75 | 4098829 | 69 |
| 100 | 6245670 | 65 |
| 128 | 9145327 | 60 |
